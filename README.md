Automatic food analysis has been an important task for not only personal dietary monitoring to treat
and control health-related problems, but can also find usage at public environments such as smart
restaurants where food recommendations are made based on calorie counting.The accurate quantifi-
cation of userâ€™s dietary intake requires measurement of the portion size or food volume in his/her diet.
For such applications a very crucial stage for correct calorie measurement is the accurate segmenta-
tion of food regions. A deep learning-based solution which estimates semantic segmentation of food
images from an input image can be a solution to this problem. This work proposes state-of-the-art
methods for image classification and segmentation, applied to food recognition. Segmentation masks
are generated from the input image and used for localisation of each food portion in the input image
based on the classification. This approach brings appealing results on semantic food segmentation.
